Command-Line Tutorial
=====================

Before you begin using rockAtlas you will need to populate some custom settings within the rockAtlas settings file.

To setup the default settings file at ``~/.config/rockAtlas/rockAtlas.yaml`` run the command:

.. code-block:: bash 
    
    rockAtlas init

This should create and open the settings file; follow the instructions in the file to populate the missing settings values (usually given an ``XXX`` placeholder).
